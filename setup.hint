ldesc: "Mathlib is a collection of hopefully-useful functions for 
working with floats, Complex numbers, and random numbers. It has the 
basic math functions added to the C99 (If your libc has them), 
trigonometric functions for complex numbers, the Mersenne Twister random 
number generator, and modules for generating random numbers in a variety 
of distributions."
